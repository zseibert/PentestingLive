# Project 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Attack

By taking the session ID of a logged in user, a user can access the change session id site to change the session id of a user that is not logged in, giving them access

Vulnerability #2: SQL injection

By changing the URL of the find salesman tab, a user can inject the following 
```

```
to implement a database SQL injection.
