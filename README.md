# Project 9 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #q: Session Hijacking
By taking the session ID of a logged in user, you can use the change session id site to change the session id of a user that is not logged in, giving them access.

Vulnerability #2: SQL injection
By changing the URL of the find salesman tab, a user can inject the following 'id=‘ OR SLEEP(3)=1--’ to implement a database SQL injection.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross Site Scripting


Vulnerability #2: User Enumeration


## Red

Vulnerability #1: CSRF


Vulnerability #2: IDOR
